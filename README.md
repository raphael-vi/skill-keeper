# Skill Keeper

Skill Keeper is a personal development tool designed to help users track and enhance their skills through structured activities and goal setting. It provides a platform for users to log daily activities, set goals, and monitor progress over time. It's really a fancy to-do app, but with a more personal taste approach to it, plus it's in JAVA which is the programming language i'm currently studying.

## Features (Yet to be implemented)

- **Skill Tracking**: Log and track various skills and associated activities.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Visualize progress with detailed charts and statistics. (
- **Goal Setting**: Set short-term and long-term goals for continuous improvement.

## Help me?
Although this is a simple project i am running into a bunch of snags along the way, i might also be building something completely wrongly that i'll only find out later. For this, if someone comes across this project and desires to offer me insights, something like "i think at this point you should do this because you're going to run into that later on" i would be deeply thankful.
